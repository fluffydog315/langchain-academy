      "answer": "To implement RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) with LangGraph, you would create a graph with nodes for retrieval and generation. First, define your state, then create nodes for document retrieval, context preparation, and generation. Connect these in a flow where retrieval happens first, followed by generation that uses the retrieved context.",

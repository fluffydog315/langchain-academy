# Error Handling Strategies for LangGraph Applications

This document outlines comprehensive error handling approaches for LangGraph applications, focusing on robustness and maintainability.

## 1. State-Based Error Tracking

LangGraph passes information between nodes using state dictionaries. This approach leverages that mechanism for error handling.

### Implementation Details:
- Add an optional `error` field to each state type definition
- When errors occur, populate this field with structured error information:
  ```python
  {
    "error_type": "APIError",
    "message": "Rate limit exceeded",
    "node": "search_web",
    "timestamp": 1713224578.45,
    "recovery_options": ["retry", "use_fallback"]
  }
  ```
- Create conditional edges in the graph that check for errors and route to appropriate recovery nodes

### Advantages:
- Fits naturally with LangGraph's state-based architecture
- Makes error state visible across the entire graph
- Allows centralized error handling logic

### Use Cases:
- Multi-step workflows where errors in early steps should affect later processing
- Complex graphs where different error types require different recovery strategies
- When you need detailed error tracking for analytics

## 2. Try-Except Blocks in Node Functions

The simplest approach is to wrap node function logic in try-except blocks.

### Implementation Details:
- Catch exceptions within each node function
- Log detailed error information
- Return graceful fallbacks when possible:
  ```python
  def search_web(state):
      try:
          # Search logic here
          return {"search_results": results}
      except Exception as e:
          logger.error(f"Search failed: {str(e)}")
          # Return empty results or cached results
          return {"search_results": []}
  ```

### Advantages:
- Straightforward implementation
- Localized error handling
- No changes required to graph structure

### Use Cases:
- Simple graphs where nodes operate independently
- When you want to contain errors within individual components
- During development and testing phases

## 3. Decorator-Based Error Handling

Create decorators to provide consistent error handling across node functions.

### Implementation Details:
- Create a `@safe_node` decorator that catches exceptions
- Add retries for transient errors (especially for LLM calls)
- Standardize error reporting across all nodes:
  ```python
  @safe_node(max_retries=3, fallback_response={"results": []})
  def call_llm(state):
      # LLM call logic here
      return {"llm_response": response}
  ```

### Advantages:
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Reduces code duplication
- Makes node functions cleaner and more focused

### Use Cases:
- When calling external services that may have transient failures
- For standardizing error handling across many similar nodes
- When you want to separate error handling logic from business logic

## 4. Checkpoint and Recovery System

For long-running processes, implement checkpoints to allow recovery from failures.

### Implementation Details:
- Save state at critical points in the graph
- Create a checkpoint manager:
  ```python
  class CheckpointManager:
      def save_checkpoint(self, state, checkpoint_id):
          # Save state to persistent storage
          
      def load_checkpoint(self, checkpoint_id):
          # Load state from persistent storage
  ```
- Add recovery nodes that can restore from checkpoints

### Advantages:
- Prevents complete restart after failures
- Preserves expensive computation results
- Supports long-running, multi-step processes

### Use Cases:
- Multi-step research processes with expensive LLM calls
- When running multiple parallel tasks that may fail independently
- For workflows that may need to be paused and resumed

## 5. Graph-Level Error Routing

Add special error handling paths in your graph.

### Implementation Details:
- Create dedicated error handling nodes
- Add conditional edges that check for errors:
  ```python
  def check_for_errors(state):
      if "error" in state:
          return "handle_error"
      return "continue_normal_flow"
  ```
- Implement recovery strategies based on error types

### Advantages:
- Makes error handling explicit in the graph structure
- Enables complex recovery workflows
- Separates normal processing from error handling

### Use Cases:
- Complex graphs with multiple possible failure points
- When different errors require very different recovery strategies
- When you want to visualize error flows in graph representations

## 6. Monitoring and Logging

Comprehensive logging and monitoring to detect and diagnose issues.

### Implementation Details:
- Add structured logging throughout the system:
  ```python
  logger = logging.getLogger("langgraph")
  logger.info("Processing node: %s with inputs: %s", node_name, inputs)
  ```
- Track node execution times and success rates
- Create alerts for recurring errors

### Advantages:
- Provides visibility into system operation
- Helps identify recurring issues
- Supports performance optimization

### Use Cases:
- Production deployments where reliability is critical
- When debugging complex workflows
- For gathering analytics on system performance

## 7. Custom Error Types

Create domain-specific error types for better error classification and handling.

### Implementation Details:
- Define custom exception classes for different error categories:
  ```python
  class LLMError(Exception):
      """Base class for LLM-related errors"""
      
  class TokenLimitError(LLMError):
      """Raised when token limit is exceeded"""
  ```
- Use these in your exception handling to enable targeted recovery

### Advantages:
- More precise error handling
- Better error categorization
- Clearer error messages

### Use Cases:
- Complex systems with many different possible error types
- When different errors require very specific handling
- For improving error reporting and diagnostics

## 8. Graceful Degradation

Design the system to continue functioning with reduced capabilities when parts fail.

### Implementation Details:
- Identify critical vs. non-critical components
- Provide fallback mechanisms for key services:
  ```python
  def get_context(state):
      try:
          return {"context": search_web(query)}
      except:
          # Fall back to using just the query without additional context
          return {"context": []}
  ```
- Design components to work with partial or missing inputs

### Advantages:
- Increases overall system resilience
- Provides better user experience during partial outages
- Reduces cascading failures

### Use Cases:
- User-facing applications where availability is critical
- Systems with multiple independent capabilities
- When some functionality is nice-to-have but not essential

## Implementation Recommendations

For a LangGraph research project, consider this phased approach:

1. Start with basic try-except blocks in critical nodes (LLM calls, external services)
2. Add state-based error tracking for cross-node error visibility
3. Implement retry logic for transient errors (especially API calls)
4. Add checkpoint capabilities for long-running processes
5. Gradually introduce more sophisticated approaches as needed

## Common Error Scenarios in LLM Applications

- **LLM API Errors**: Rate limits, context window overflows, timeout issues
- **Validation Errors**: Malformed data from LLMs, schema validation failures
- **External Service Errors**: Search API failures, database connectivity issues
- **Processing Logic Errors**: Unexpected data structures or edge cases
- **Resource Constraints**: Memory limits, CPU constraints, token budget exhaustion

## Debugging and Testing Recommendations

- Create test cases for each error scenario
- Use mock services to simulate failures
- Implement comprehensive logging
- Consider chaos engineering approaches to test resilience
- Review error patterns regularly to identify system improvements
